Motivation

Compatibility Risk
  Firefox: {{feature.ff_views.text}}
  Internet Explorer: {{feature.ie_views.text}}
  Safari: {{feature.safari_views.text}}

Describe the degree of compatibility risk you believe this change poses:
  <summary>If you don't have a launch tracking bug or row in the feature dashboard, include in this email links to relevant specs, standards discussions, or documentation about support for the feature in other browsers.</summary>

Ongoing technical constraints
  <summary>Do you anticipate adding any ongoing technical constraints to the codebase while implementing this feature? We prefer to avoid features which require or assume a specific architecture. For most features, the answer here is "None."</summary>

Will this feature be supported on all five Blink platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Chrome OS and Android)? Yes or no.
  <summary>If no, explain why certain platforms will not be included in your implementation.</summary>

OWP launch tracking bug
  {% if feature.spec_link %}<a href="{{feature.bug_url}}">{{feature.bug_url}}</a>{% else %}None{% endif %}

Entry in {{APP_TITLE}}
  <a href="{{edit_url}}">{{edit_url}}</a>

Requesting approval to ship?
  <summary>"No" - you will be implementing your feature behind a runtime flag and sending an Intent to Ship email when you're ready to enable by default.
"Yes" - your change is small and you'd like to ship enabled-by-default immediately. Per the launch process for new features, you'll need LGTMs from 3 API OWNERS before shipping. If "yes," please change the title of the email to â€œIntent to Implement and Ship: ...".</summary>
